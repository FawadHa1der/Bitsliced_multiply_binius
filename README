This repo contains the a bitslice impl in C, high level Verilog combinatorial Circuit and a corresponding C file for 64 bit tower field multiplication thats used in the binius protocol.

64 bit high level verilog circuit has 729 AND Gates and 3383 XOR gates.
32 bit high level verilog circuit has 243 AND Gates and 1064 XOR gates.
16 bit high level verilog circuit has 81 AND Gates and 323 XOR gates.
8 bit high level verilog circuit has 27 AND Gates and 92 XOR gates.


This is a WIP. Test for verilog and C will be added soon


And please ask permission before any of the circuits are used for profit/commercial purposes.
