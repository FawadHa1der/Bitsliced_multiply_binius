This repo contains the a bitslice impl in C, high level Verilog combinatorial Circuit and a corresponding C file for 64 bit tower field multiplication thats used in the binius protocol.

It has 729 AND Gates and 3626 XOR gates which probably need a lot of improvement. I am not a circuit designer....


This is a WIP. Test for verilog and C will be added soon
